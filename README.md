Business decision: 
High spending group - The credit limit of the group can be increased thereby encouraging them for more purchases. 
Medium spending group - They can be made to purchase more by offering them premium cards or loyalty cards to increase or promote their transactions. 
Low spending group - Offers can be provided on early payments to improve their payment rate.
