# Project: Bank Customer Segmentation to give promotional offers to customers
Analysis: Concepts of clustering were used to draw inferences and identify the spending groups.

Outcome: 3 spending groups â€“ high, medium and low were identified.

Business decision: High spending group - The credit limit of the group can be increased thereby encouraging them for more purchases. Medium spending group - They can be made to purchase more by offering them premium cards or loyalty cards to increase or promote their transactions. Low spending group - Offers can be provided on early payments to improve their payment rate.
